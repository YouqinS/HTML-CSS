				<p>The background-image property sets one or more background images for an element.

                The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).

                 By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

                 Tip: Always set a background-color to be used if the image is unavailable.

  				<p class="para"> Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. 
  				                  It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, 
  				                  fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by 
  				                  the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.

                              Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, 
                              the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied 
                              by the food industry.
