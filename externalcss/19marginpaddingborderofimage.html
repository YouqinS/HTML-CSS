  				<p class="para3"> Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. 
  				                  It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, 
  				                  fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by 
  				                  the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.

                              Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, 
                              the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied 
                              by the food industry.
