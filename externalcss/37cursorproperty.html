                Values <br>

    <uri>


    auto <br>
    The UA determines the cursor to display based on the current context.
     <br>

    crosshair<br>
    A simple crosshair.<br>


    default<br>
    The platform-dependent default cursor. Often rendered as an arrow.
<br>

    pointer<br>
    The cursor is a pointer that indicates a link.
<br>

    move<br>
    Indicates something is to be moved.<br>


    e-resize, ne-resize, nw-resize, n-resize, se-resize, sw-resize, s-resize, w-resize
    Indicate that some edge is to be moved. For example, the 'se-resize' cursor is used when the movement starts from the south-east corner of the box.


    text
    Indicates text that may be selected. Often rendered as an I-beam.


    wait
    Indicates that the program is busy and the user should wait. Often rendered as a watch or hourglass.


    help
    Help is available for the object under the cursor. Often rendered as a question mark or a balloon.


    progress
    A progress indicator. The program is performing some processing, but is different from 'wait' in that the user may still interact with the program. Often rendered as a spinning beach ball, or an arrow with a watch or hourglass.


    inherit
    Takes the same specified value as the property for the element's parent.
